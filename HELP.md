# Getting Started
INSTRUCTIONS:
    add and or change ACTIVE_PROFILE environment variable to choose the correct properties.
    the various property files will determine the application behaviour:
    1. production - HelperInitializer will be DISABLED and JPA will connect to the PRODUCTION db
        changes you will make WILL NOT be deleted from the database when you shut down the server.
    2. staging - HelperInitializer will be ENABLED and JPA will connect to the STAGING db
        this setting is appropriate for testing in similar environment to production
        changes you will make WILL be deleted from the database when you shut down the server.
    3. test - HelperInitializer will be DISABLED and JPA will connect to H2,
        this setting is appropriate for unit testing
        or if you wish to play with the app locally with no effect on any database
    BY DEFAULT THE APPLICATION WILL START WITH STAGING PROPERTIES APPLIED

Similarly, environment variables are needed to connect to the DB, you may find them in our [project folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10RyL90qONrEUS2BbO4fNHSUQx6-8Dg6B?usp=share_link).
